## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS styling properties and variables
- Flexbox
- Consideration for mobile and tablet devices

### What I learned

From this project I have reaffirmed my strength in mentally knowing the structure of react apps/ components. In terms of learing, media queries was where I had enhanced my understading, to accomodate the cards with all widths, even the in-between devices (laptop - tablet etc.). It has also helped me to gauge and asses sizing based on the design spec an no exact measurements.

### Continued development

I would mainily like to imporve my efficienty when creating cards. Some aspects, like the HTML side and flexbox were very quick for me to consturct, but others I needed to take my time and implement a little trial and error, like figuring out sizing for smaller widths, and in this I will develop from more proejcts.

### Useful resources

- [https://usepastel.com/responsive-website-test](Responsive checker) - As well as inspector on chrome, this website checker was used to reaffirm the responsiveness on smaller screen sizes.
